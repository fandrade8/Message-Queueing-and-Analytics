This project expands on Project 2, adding asynchronous posting and hashtag analytics.
If you did not complete Project 2, you can use the Mockroblog database and skeleton code for the Timelines API to implement the postTweet(username, text) method.
The project may be completed individually or in a group of no more than three (3) people. All students on the team must be enrolled in the same section of the course.
Message Queueing
The postTweet(username, text) method (or its Mockroblog equivalent using sandman2) is currently synchronous, updating the database before returning a result. This is a reasonable choice as long as traffic remains relatively steady and within the limits that the server can handle. If the traffic spikes suddenly, the database may no longer be able to keep up.
We will address this by introducing RQ, a message queueing service based on the Redis key-value data store.
